## About the book
This new edition of the Azure Data Factory Cookbook, fully updated to reflect ADS V2, will help you get up and running by showing you how to create and execute your first job in ADF. 
You’ll learn how to branch and chain activities, create custom activities, and schedule pipelines, as well as discover the benefits of Cloud Data Warehousing, Azure Synapse Analytics, and Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. 
With practical recipes, you’ll learn how to actively engage with analytical tools from Azure Data Services and leverage your on-premises infrastructure with cloud-native tools to get relevant business insights. As you advance, you’ll be able to integrate the most commonly used Azure Services into ADF and understand how Azure services can be useful in designing ETL pipelines. You'll familiarize yourself with the common errors that you may encounter while working with ADF and find out how to use the Azure portal to monitor pipelines. You’ll also understand error messages and resolve problems in Connectors and Data Flows with the debugging capabilities of ADF. 
By the end of this book, you’ll be able to use ADF as the main ETL and orchestration tool for your data warehouse or data platform projects.

### Chapter 01, Getting Started with ADF
Chapter 1, Getting Started with ADF, will provide a general introduction to the Azure data platform.
In this chapter, you will learn about the ADF interface and options as well as common use cases.
You will perform hand s-on exercises in order to fi nd ADF in the Azure portal and create your fi rst
ADF job.


### Chapter 02, Orchestration and Control Flow
Chapter 2, Orchestration and Control Flow, will introduce you to the building blocks of data processing
in ADF. The chapter contains hands-on exercises that show you how to set up linked
services and datasets for your data sources, use various types of activities, design data-processing
workfl ows, and create triggers for data transfers.


### Chapter 03, Setting Up Synapse Analytics
